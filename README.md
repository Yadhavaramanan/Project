## Overview
This project leverages Flash for real-time speech-to-text conversion. It captures audio input from a user's microphone and processes it to provide textual output.

## Features
- Real-time audio capture and processing
- Conversion of speech to text using Flash
- Lightweight and efficient

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Adobe Flash Player (latest version)
- A modern web browser supporting Flash
- A working microphone

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/flash-speech-to-text.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

3. Grant microphone access when prompted.

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Click the microphone icon to start capturing audio.
3. Speak clearly into the microphone.
4. The transcribed text will appear on the screen in real-time.

## Development

### Tools
- Flash Development Environment (e.g., Adobe Animate)
- JavaScript for handling user interactions

### Key Functions
- **Audio Capture**: Uses Flash to access the user's microphone.
- **Speech Processing**: Converts the audio stream to text.

### Customization
